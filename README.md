This repository contains a Python script designed to log GPS data from NMEA sentences received via a serial connection. The script captures real-time geographic coordinates, converts them into a decimal format, and adjusts the timestamp from UTC to the local timezone (Eastern Time). This project showcases the integration of hardware interfacing with software solutions in Python, demonstrating real-time data processing and file handling.

Technologies Used
Python 3.8
Pytz
Serial Communication
Features
Real-time GPS Data Acquisition: Reads NMEA sentences directly from a GPS module connected via serial.
Coordinate Conversion: Converts latitude and longitude from degrees and minutes to a decimal format.
Timezone Adjustment: Converts UTC time to Eastern Time, formatted for readability.
Data Logging: Efficiently logs processed data to a text file, including timestamps, latitude, longitude, and altitude.
